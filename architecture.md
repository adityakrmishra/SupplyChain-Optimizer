# System Design

The `SupplyChain-Optimizer` is designed to predict supply chain disruptions and optimize logistics routes using AI/ML techniques. The system's architecture comprises several key components:

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**:
   - **External Data Sources**:
     - **Weather Data**: Utilizes the NOAA API to fetch real-time weather information.
     - **News Data**: Implements NLP models, such as BERT, to analyze news sentiment for geopolitical risk assessment.
   - **Internal Data Sources**:
     - **Historical Supply Chain Data**: Gathers past data on supply chain operations.
     - **Logistics Information**: Collects data on current logistics and transportation networks.

2. **Data Processing Layer**:
   - **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Processes raw data to ensure quality and consistency.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features for predictive modeling.

3. **Prediction Layer**:
   - **Disruption Prediction Models**: Employs time-series forecasting and machine learning models to predict potential supply chain disruptions based on processed data.

4. **Optimization Layer**:
   - **Route Optimization Algorithms**: Implements multi-objective optimization techniques to determine optimal logistics routes, considering factors like cost, time, and carbon footprint.
   - **Real-time Traffic and Geospatial Constraints**: Integrates tools like OSRM or GraphHopper to account for current traffic conditions and geospatial limitations.

5. **Blockchain Integration Layer**:
   - **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security in supply chain transactions.

6. **API Layer**:
   - **FastAPI Framework**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for interaction with the system's functionalities.

7. **Frontend Interface**:
   - **User Dashboard**: Offers a web-based interface for users to visualize predictions, optimized routes, and other relevant information.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: The system collects data from both external and internal sources.
2. **Data Processing**: The collected data undergoes cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
3. **Prediction & Optimization**: Processed data is fed into predictive models to forecast disruptions and into optimization algorithms to determine optimal routes.
4. **API Exposure**: Results from predictions and optimizations are exposed via API endpoints.
5. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system through the frontend interface, accessing insights and making informed decisions.
